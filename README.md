This mod makes several changes to the behavior of the SH282 steam locomotive in Derail Valley.

1. In vanilla DV, the cutoff wheel behaves oddly and unrealistically: There is a different position for optimum power that depends on the locomotive's speed. In this mod, more cutoff (further from center) always gives more power, and reduced cutoff (positions closer to the center) gives dramatically better efficiency.

2. Steam consumption is proportional to locomotive speed. More speed = more piston strokes = more steam required. 

3. Boiler steam production is substantially reduced.

In combination, this has some very noticeable effects on how the steamer performs.

You will spend most of your time underway at very low cutoff settings, 15% or less, just as in reality.

As long as you have the traction necessary to move the train, you can climb grades of virtually any length without running out of steam. The SH282 is capable of moving massive loads up grades, albeit slowly. Managing your sand is vital, and be careful not to lose steam through the safety valve!

The boiler has significant trouble maintaining pressure when sustaining high-speeds of 80+ kph. Just as in reality, this is the most demanding situation for a boiler's power output.

It is quite viable to use the SH282 as an efficient shunter, or even as a quasi-fireless locomotive, operating at low speeds and high tractive effort from steam pressure in the boiler.
